# CodeAlpha_Handwritten_Character_Recognition
# Handwritten Character Recognition

## Overview

This project focuses on **recognizing handwritten characters** using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The model learns from labeled handwritten character images and predicts the corresponding character.

## Objective

* Preprocess handwritten image data
* Train a classification model for character recognition
* Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy, Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow / Keras (if used)

## Dataset

* Handwritten character image dataset
* Images are converted into numerical features for model training
* Target: Character labels (A–Z / digits, depending on dataset)

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

Run all cells in the notebook.

## Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Loss
* Confusion Matrix
